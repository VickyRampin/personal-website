	<p>I've been doing this thing for a while that has recently 100% launched -- the LIS Scholarship Archive! An open source, open access disciplinary repository for library and information science.</p>

	<p>The <a href="https://osf.io/preprints/lissa">LIS Scholarship Archive</a> (<a href="https://osf.io/preprints/lissa">osf.io/preprints/lissa</a>) has fully launched and we are ready to help you open your work! The LIS Scholarship Archive, in partnership with the Center for Open Science, is a free, open, and community-led archive for scholarship in library and information science and allied fields.The infrastructure of LISSA is completely open source and all materials and associated metadata on LISSA will be permanently, publicly available.</p>

	<p>On LISSA, LIS workers, students, trainees, and other in the field can make their incredible work open and discoverable, from metadata records to oral histories to manuscripts to data. Currently on LISSA, there are preprints, postprints, grant narratives, posters, book manuscripts, data, and code, in a variety of languages, from a diverse authorship! Letâ€™s keep this going! If you are someone who works in LIS and who supports open scholarship, this is what you can do:</p>

	<ul>
	   <li><a href="https://osf.io/preprints/lissa/submit">Submit your work</a> in less than 5min. </li>
	   <li>Spread the word about LISSA, and encourage others to submit their work!</li>
	</ul><br/>

	<p>You can always get updates from LISSA on <a href="https://lissarchive.org/">lissarchive.org</a> or Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/lissarchive">@LISSArchive</a> (<a  href="https://twitter.com/LISSA_SCHOL">@LISSA_SCHOL</a> for a feed of new uploads!) or via email (<a href="lissarchive@gmail.com">lissarchive@gmail.com</a>).
