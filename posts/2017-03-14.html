	<!-- TEASER_END -->

	<p>I participated in two sessions at this, my first ACRL -- the first was a roundtable on reproducibility, and how libraries/librarians are getting involved. We made a <a href="https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1h0hpKEJaNdqLXKUKsAZNA0zYRoAuYmHo7Bg7jpgskIc/edit?usp=sharing">cute handout</a> and kept <a href="https://goo.gl/kdd8yB">running notes</a> for those who wanted to hear some thoughts but didn't get a chance to make the talk. The second session I participated in was an excellent roundtable</p>

		<li><strong>YOU CAN ACTUALLY PLAN CONFERENCES & BE CONSIDERATE ABOUT INTROVERTS</strong>: there were so many rooms, events, and crafts available for folks of all different comfort levels in crowds or in the mega-conference environment. There were guided meditation sessions and yoga sessions every few hours of every day of the conference, there was a table filled with crafting supplies such as coloring pages and markers/crayons/colored pencils and yarn + knitting needles/crochet hooks, and there was a quiet room for folks to decompress (with places to charge a phone!). I really, really appreciated this level of detail.</li>
