			<p>Rémi is from France, and we spent most of the trip in his hometown with his family. It was unbelievably gorgeous! The south of France is like the promise land for anyone like myself, who loves wine + cheese + food + hiking + beach all in one spot. Since I am a complete and utter nerd, I made a photo book with some text to document the trip. Here's it embedded and well-described! You're welcome, LAM friends.</p>
