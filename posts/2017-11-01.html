    <p>Hi! So I am trying my hand at NaNoWriMo again this year! I am officially participating in <a href="http://nanowrimo.org/">NaNoWriMo</a> 2017, or "National Novel Writing Month." This means, by November 30, 2017, I will have written a 50,000-word novel.</p>

	<p></p>    
	<p>Last year I got to just around 10,000 words, and then Drumpf was elected and I couldn't concentrate on writing. My goal this year is to at least get halfway done (25,000 words) and have an actual written plan for my novel in advance (which I did complete!).</p>
