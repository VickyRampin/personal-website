			<p>I just got back from the most BEAUTIFUL two week vacation in France with my S.O., Rémi! It was my first time in France, and my second time in Western Europe -- backstory: I did an extensive trip of Eastern Europe in 2014, but only have been to Ireland in the West (I lived there).</p>

			<p>Rémi is from France, and we spent most of the trip in his hometown with his family. It was unbelievably gorgeous! The south of France is like the promise land for anyone like myself, who loves wine + cheese + food + hiking + beach all in one spot. Since I am a complete and utter nerd, I made a photo book with some text to document the trip. Here's it embedded and well-described! You're welcome, LAM friends.</p>
