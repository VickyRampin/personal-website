    <p class="lead">  Hi! I'm Vicky Steeves. I am a librarian specializing in digital preservation &amp; science data. On this site you can find out more about me, my work, and probably see more pictures of my cat than you ever wanted to. But he's super cute so....you decide if that's a bad thing. Welcome! </p>
    
    <p>I recently accepted a position at New York University Libraries as the Research Data Management and Reproducibility librarian as of August 2015! I will provide instructional and consultation services to the NYU Community in Research Data Management, as well as pilot curation practices while monitoring researcher needs across disciplines. Additionally, I will be directly involved in supporting the Moore-Sloan Data Science Environment Partnership at NYU, working on the reproducibility of scientific research data. I recently completed the National Digital Stewardship Residency at the American Museum of Natural History. My project was to gain a broad overview of the extent and status of AMNH digital assets pertaining to Science. To do so I developed a structured interview guide designed to measure and describe scientific digital assets resulting in a metric to predict ongoing data curation needs.
    
    <p>Other interests include: gaming (pencil &amp; paper and PC), crafting (embroidery, sewing, knitting, crocheting, quilting, scrapbooking--you name it), animal care (especially my kitten Little Boss!), snowboarding, and hiking.</p><br/>
