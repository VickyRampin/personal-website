	abstract = {Reproducibility in the computational sciences has been stymied because of the complex and rapidly changing computational environments in which modern research takes place. While many will espouse reproducibility as a value, the challenge of making it happen (both for themselves and testing the reproducibility of others' work) often outweigh the benefits. There have been a few reproducibility solutions designed and implemented by the community. In particular, the authors are contributors to ReproZip, a tool to enable computational reproducibility by tracing and bundling together research in the environment in which it takes place (e.g. one's computer or server). In this white paper, we introduce a tool for unpacking ReproZip bundles in the cloud, ReproServer. ReproServer takes an uploaded ReproZip bundle (.rpz file) or a link to a ReproZip bundle, and users can then unpack them in the cloud via their browser, allowing them to reproduce colleagues' work without having to install anything locally. This will help lower the barrier to reproducing others' work, which will aid reviewers in verifying the claims made in papers and reusing previously published research.},

	abstract = {While dynamic and interactive Web applications are becoming increasingly common to convey news and stories to people all around the world, their technological complexity makes it hard to archive and preserve such applications, and as such, they are being lost. We present ReproZip-Web, an open-source prototype aimed at saving these news applications from extinction. ReproZip-Web leverages ReproZip, a computational reproducibility tool, and Webrecorder, a tool for recording Web resources, to automatically and transparently capture and replay dynamic Websites. The prototype creates a bundle that contains all the information needed to reproduce a news application, and its lightweight nature makes it ideal for distribution and preservation. We will present our ongoing work on the prototype, and also discuss some use cases and avenues for future development.},

	abstract = {Digital stewardship is a rapidly maturing field within library and information science. This domain engages in the active and long-term management of digital objects towards their preservation for and unencumbered access by future generations. Although this field is growing quickly, it lacks a compentancy profile for practioners that is commonplace in LIS (example: the American Library Association's Core Compentencies of Librarianship). This study sought to fill that gap by creating a profile of the skills, responsibilities, and knowledge areas that define competency in digital stewardship, based on three key datasets: 1) literature in the field through a literature review (to define the scope of the profile), 2) NDSR project descriptions, qualitatively analyzed to get a baseline understanding of expected competencies 3) the results of a survey given to current and past NDSR residents, quantitively evaluated to illustrate competencies’ importance to professional success.},
