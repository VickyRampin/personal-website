So I've made the really scary decision to participate in &lt;a href="http://nanowrimo.org/"&gt;NaNoWriMo&lt;/a&gt; 2016, or "National Novel Writing Month." This means, by November 30, 2016, I will have written a full-length, 50,000 word novel.&lt;/p&gt;

This was my first ever peer reviewed paper and it was accepted! Not a bad first time üòÅ. Our presentation went really well -- there was good audience engagement and it seemed like there was real potential for people to extend or use our study (with all our &lt;a href="https://osf.io/zndwq/"&gt;open access data&lt;/a&gt;!). One of my favourite moments was right after our presentation, when an audience member (whose name escapes me, I'm so sorry if you're reading this!) told us that we were part of very few people he'd seen accurately use grounded theory. I doubt this is true, but it was flattering nonetheless.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Hello everyone! Vicky here to bring you some holiday cheer. I thought, since this is our last post before Hanukkah, Yule, Life Day, Festivus, Kwanzaa , Pancha Ganapati, Soyal, the Dongzhi Festival, Christmas, Newtonmas, Boxing Day, Omisoka, and New Years, I could wind down a busy few months by talking about the American Museum of Natural History party season!&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Just about every day of the week, starting from the 10th of December to the 19th, there is a party at the AMNH. Each department has their own parties, some are small and attended mostly by people within the department; others are all staff events with food, drinks, and music.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;The Library kicked off the party season this year, with probably 50+ people eating and drinking in the reading room (it‚Äôs only one night of the year, librarian friends who are cringing!) as the night went on. ¬†This was a great opportunity for me to better get to know many of the scientists that I've interviewed for my NDSR project in a more informal environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://vickysteeves.com/blog/party-on-amnh/"&gt;Read more‚Ä¶&lt;/a&gt; (3 min remaining to read)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>amnh</category><category>ndsr</category><category>personal</category><guid>http://vickysteeves.com/blog/party-on-amnh/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 18 Dec 2014 18:08:25 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
