This was my first ever peer reviewed paper and it was accepted! Not a bad first time üòÅ. Our presentation went really well -- there was good audience engagement and it seemed like there was real potential for people to extend or use our study (with all our &lt;a href="https://osf.io/zndwq/"&gt;open access data&lt;/a&gt;!). One of my favourite moments was right after our presentation, when an audience member (whose name escapes me, I'm so sorry if you're reading this!) told us that we were part of very few people he'd seen accurately use grounded theory. I doubt this is true, but it was flattering nonetheless.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Last year during NDSR, it seemed like I was giving a presentation at a conference, professional organization meeting, webinar, etc. every other week. It‚Äôs been exceptionally restful (well, sort of...) to spend these past 5 months getting to know NYU, my colleagues, the scope of my work, and really just getting a feel for my day-to-day. &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;One of the most exciting outputs from my first semester here at NYU has surrounded my work on the Moore-Sloan Data Science Environment (msdse.org). Back in October (link to Oct 2015 post), I wrote about the MSDSE Summit that was held at Suncadia Resort in Washington state. God it was so incredibly beautiful there and I got to do some really cool stuff, but the best thing that happened was definitely meeting &lt;a href="http://guides.lib.uw.edu/friendly.php?s=research/jmuilenburg"&gt;Jenny Muilenburg&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://bids.berkeley.edu/people/erik-mitchell"&gt; Erik Mitchell&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://vickysteeves.com/blog/presenting-CNI/"&gt;Read more‚Ä¶&lt;/a&gt; (2 min remaining to read)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>conference report</category><category>presentation</category><category>professional development</category><guid>http://vickysteeves.com/blog/presenting-CNI/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 16 Dec 2015 18:08:25 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
