After just about a year of emails, hangouts, and calls, I was excited to see the space in which I think some really innovative tech is being developed for the open X community. The second week of July was designated as SHARE week: Monday and Tuesday was the SHARE hackathon, Wednesday and half of Thursday was the SHARE community meeting, and the last half of Thursday and Friday was the SHARE Curation Associates kick off orientation. &lt;/p&gt;

Conferences.</title><link>http://vickysteeves.com/blog/so-many-conferences/</link><dc:creator>Vicky Steeves</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;My first two weeks of May have been just explicitly devoted to conferences. Planning, executing, attending, surveying -- you name it, I've been doing it in relation to some event or another. It's actually been great, but &lt;em&gt;so exhausting&lt;/em&gt;. I am definitely giving a lot of props to event planners for doing this as their day-to-day.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;So, I kind of am in love with the &lt;a href="https://www.force11.org/meetings/force2016"&gt;FORCE conference&lt;/a&gt; I just went to. FORCE2016 is the annual conference from an organization called FORCE11 (ha, the year they started the org.). This year, 500 people came from around the world: researchers, librarians, software developers, large scale repositories, open science advocates, and everyone in between. It was not only a very diverse conference in terms of home country and job, but also in the way the conference and program was run.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;First, one of the coolest things I have ever seen: in addition to the MULTITUDE of tweets around the event (seriously everyone was so active, it was amazing), they hired a company to take visual notes!! While everything was going on!! Everyone, the gist of their talks, panels, lightning talks, EVERYTHING! Such a great idea and it produced a great visual overview of the con!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://vickysteeves.com/blog/force-2016/"&gt;Read more…&lt;/a&gt; (5 min remaining to read)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>conference report</category><category>professional development</category><guid>http://vickysteeves.com/blog/force-2016/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 20 Apr 2016 18:08:25 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Goals for 2016 and How I'll Make Them Happen</title><link>http://vickysteeves.com/blog/goals-for-2016/</link><dc:creator>Vicky Steeves</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you've been following this blog for a while, or even took a quick look on my 
  &lt;a href="http://vickysteeves.com/resume.html"&gt;resume&lt;/a&gt; page, you'll see I haven't been at my position
  at NYU for very long. January 3rd marks the fifth month (to the day!) that I've been
  NYU's official "Research Data Management and Reproducibility Librarian." There was a
  bit of an adjustment period where I just spent the majority of my time introducing
  myself to my colleagues, getting to know what my daily workflow would look like, and
  brainstorm with &lt;a href="http://nmwolf.net/"&gt;Nick&lt;/a&gt; about what our &lt;a href="http://guides.nyu.edu/data_management/services"&gt;services&lt;/a&gt; will look like, some good
  groups for targeted outreach, and what &lt;a href="http://guides.nyu.edu/DS_classes"&gt;classes&lt;/a&gt; we are going to teach as a part of
  &lt;a href="http://guides.nyu.edu/c.php?g=277095&amp;amp;p=1848849"&gt;Data Services typical
  course offerings&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;This was all well and good, but since I started in August I missed the goal-setting
  timeline that is typical for my colleagues. As such, I wanted to make some, and my
  supervisor in the library thought it would be a good way to measure growth besides.
  Plus, since I'm pretty early career, setting goals for a measurable outcome was kind of
  new for something not project based. This was just trying to assess my own growth, not
  necessarily the growth of a project I'm working on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://vickysteeves.com/blog/goals-for-2016/"&gt;Read more…&lt;/a&gt; (7 min remaining to read)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>nyu</category><category>professional development</category><guid>http://vickysteeves.com/blog/goals-for-2016/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 15 Jan 2016 18:08:25 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Presenting at CNI</title><link>http://vickysteeves.com/blog/presenting-CNI/</link><dc:creator>Vicky Steeves</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt; This month was excellent as it marked my first ever professional presentation as a NYU Librarian :) &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Last year during NDSR, it seemed like I was giving a presentation at a conference, professional organization meeting, webinar, etc. every other week. It’s been exceptionally restful (well, sort of...) to spend these past 5 months getting to know NYU, my colleagues, the scope of my work, and really just getting a feel for my day-to-day. &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;One of the most exciting outputs from my first semester here at NYU has surrounded my work on the Moore-Sloan Data Science Environment (msdse.org). Back in October (link to Oct 2015 post), I wrote about the MSDSE Summit that was held at Suncadia Resort in Washington state. God it was so incredibly beautiful there and I got to do some really cool stuff, but the best thing that happened was definitely meeting &lt;a href="http://guides.lib.uw.edu/friendly.php?s=research/jmuilenburg"&gt;Jenny Muilenburg&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://bids.berkeley.edu/people/erik-mitchell"&gt; Erik Mitchell&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://vickysteeves.com/blog/presenting-CNI/"&gt;Read more…&lt;/a&gt; (2 min remaining to read)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>conference report</category><category>presentation</category><category>professional development</category><guid>http://vickysteeves.com/blog/presenting-CNI/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 16 Dec 2015 18:08:25 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>My First LITA</title><link>http://vickysteeves.com/blog/first-LITA/</link><dc:creator>Vicky Steeves</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago, I attend the &lt;a href="http://www.ala.org/lita/"&gt;Library Information Technology Association&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="http://litaforum.org/"&gt;Forum&lt;/a&gt;. Over the 13-15th, I attended several sessions, explored Minneapolis for the first time, and met some really awesome people. I was, as always, a bit nervous attending a new conference but the organizers had some really great 101-type sessions, and even set up &lt;a href="http://litaforum.slack.com/"&gt;a Slack channel&lt;/a&gt; which I found to be immensely helpful throughout the day. People organized dinners, discussed sessions in real-time, posed questions, and uploaded some hysterical gifs.&lt;/p&gt;

I started August 3rd of this year, which turned out to be great because there were no students around. This may sound bad, but the prep time was invaluable. My partner-in-crime &lt;a href="http://www.nmwolf.net/"&gt;Nick Wolf&lt;/a&gt; came two weeks later, and together we really amped up the existing &lt;a href="http://guides.nyu.edu/data_management"&gt;data management LibGuide&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
			
		&lt;p&gt;When September rolled around, I was hit with a visual on just how gigantic a school NYU really is. Seeing all the students streaming into the library, I was hit with the scope of my work here. Nick and I were supposed to build up services around research data management/data management planning for literally everyone on campus, from staff to students to faculty. Of course to start we will focus on a few core user communities and build our way out, but just wow--even starting on building services for grad students, for example, is an awesome task.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Hi everyone, this is Vicky reporting from Portland, Oregon! I am here on the west coast for the first time attending &lt;a href="http://code4lib.org/conference/2015/"&gt;code4Lib 2015&lt;/a&gt;, and since today is the last day of the conference, I thought I’d give everyone a bit of a report about what went on here.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;First, I want to talk about the format of presentations at code4Lib. It’s absolutely unlike any other conference I’ve ever been too. There are no multiple sessions going at once. Everything is streamlined into one room. Yes--we sat in a room from 9-5pm watching 20 minute presentations, with an hour for lunch and two to three half hour breaks. This sounds really daunting but I have to tell you--it was so refreshing! I’ll talk a little bit more about the actual presentations later on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://vickysteeves.com/blog/code4lib-2015/"&gt;Read more…&lt;/a&gt; (7 min remaining to read)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>conference report</category><category>ndsr</category><category>professional development</category><guid>http://vickysteeves.com/blog/code4lib-2015/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 12 Feb 2015 18:08:25 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Prove Yourself: Needs Assessment Edition</title><link>http://vickysteeves.com/blog/prove-yourself-needs-assessment/</link><dc:creator>Vicky Steeves</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://ndsr.nycdigital.org/prove-yourself-needs-assessment-edition/"&gt;See original posting here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	  
			&lt;p&gt;What I’ve come to love about the library science field (which after years of waiting tables you’d think I’d hate) is the service aspect to everything we do. Librarians are intensely user-focused in all of our work: through the use of needs assessment surveys, we mold our libraries to what users want, expect, and need. We use the results to design programs, buy technology, even create positions within a library (YA librarian is a thing because of that!). Some common ways to implement a library assessment include  focus groups, interviews, scorecards, comment cards, usage statistics from circulation and reference, and surveys sent to users via email or on paper.&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;This past week, I attended a workshop with the fabulous &lt;a href="http://ndsr.nycdigital.org/author/jkim/"&gt;Julia Kim&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href="http://metro.org/"&gt;METRO&lt;/a&gt; that focused on the implementation and design aspects of surveying, called "Assessment in Focus: Designing and Implementing an Effective User Feedback Survey." The presenter, &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nisabakkalbasi"&gt;Nisa Bakkalbasi&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://library.columbia.edu/bts/assessment.html"&gt;assessment coordinator&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href="http://library.columbia.edu/"&gt;Columbia University Libraries/Information Services&lt;/a&gt;, was a former statistician and presented on the many ways one could glean statistically valuable quantitative data from simple survey questions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://vickysteeves.com/blog/prove-yourself-needs-assessment/"&gt;Read more…&lt;/a&gt; (6 min remaining to read)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>assessment</category><category>ndsr</category><category>professional development</category><guid>http://vickysteeves.com/blog/prove-yourself-needs-assessment/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 10 Nov 2014 18:08:25 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
