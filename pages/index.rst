    <p class="lead">  Hi!! I'm Vicky Rampin (née Steeves). I am a librarian specializing in data management and reproducibility. Here you'll find out more about me, my work, and probably see more pictures of my cat than you ever wanted to.</p>

    <p>​I'm the Librarian for Research Data Management and Reproducibility, a dual appointment between NYU's Division of Libraries and Center for Data Science. I support students, faculty, staff, and researchers in creating well-managed, high quality, and reproducible research through facilitating use of tools such as ReproZip. My research centers on integrating reproducible practices into the research workflow, advocating openness in all facets of research (manuscripts, code, data, analysis tools, etc.), and building/contributing to open infrastructure.​ I am also the co-founder of <a href="https://osf.io/preprints/lissa">the LIS Scholarship Archive</a>, a repository for library and information science scholarship.</p>

    <p>I am an alum of the National Digital Stewardship Residency New York (2014-15 cohort), at the American Museum of Natural History. My project was to gain a broad overview of the extent and status of AMNH digital assets pertaining to Science. To do so I developed a structured interview guide designed to measure and describe scientific digital assets resulting in a metric to predict ongoing data curation needs. Other interests include: gaming (pencil &amp; paper and PC), crafting (embroidery, sewing, knitting, crocheting, quilting, scrapbooking--you name it), animal care (especially my kitten Little Boss!), snowboarding, and hiking.</p>
