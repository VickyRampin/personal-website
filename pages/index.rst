    <p class="lead">  Hi!! I'm Vicky Rampin (née Steeves). I am a librarian specializing in data management and reproducibility. I am also an advocate for open scholarship!</p>

    <p>​I'm the Librarian for Research Data Management and Reproducibility, as well as the subject specialist librarian for data science at New York University Libraries. I support students, faculty, and staff in creating well-managed, high quality, and reproducible research. My research centers on integrating reproducible practices into the research workflow, advocating openness in all facets of research (manuscripts, code, data, analysis tools, etc.), and building/contributing to open infrastructure.​ I am also the co-founder of <a href="https://osf.io/preprints/lissa">the LIS Scholarship Archive</a>, a repository for library and information science scholarship. I work on <a href="https://www.taguette.org/">Taguette</a>, an free and open source qualitative analysis tool, as well as <a href="https://www.reprozip.org/">ReproZip</a>, a free and open source computational reproducibility tool.</p>

    <p>I am an alum of the National Digital Stewardship Residency New York (2014-15 cohort), at the American Museum of Natural History, which sparked my love of data librarianship and underscore to me the importance of digital preservation to data librarianship. My project was to gain a broad overview of the extent and status of AMNH digital assets pertaining to Science. To do so I developed a structured interview guide designed to measure and describe scientific digital assets resulting in a metric to predict ongoing data curation needs. Other interests include: gaming (pencil &amp; paper, switch, and PC), crafting (embroidery, sewing, knitting, crocheting, quilting, scrapbooking--you name it), animal care (especially my kitten Little Boss!), snowboarding, and hiking.</p>
