So I've made the really scary decision to participate in &lt;a href="http://nanowrimo.org/"&gt;NaNoWriMo&lt;/a&gt; 2016, or "National Novel Writing Month." This means, by November 30, 2016, I will have written a full-length, 50,000 word novel.&lt;/p&gt;

This was my first ever peer reviewed paper and it was accepted! Not a bad first time üòÅ. Our presentation went really well -- there was good audience engagement and it seemed like there was real potential for people to extend or use our study (with all our &lt;a href="https://osf.io/zndwq/"&gt;open access data&lt;/a&gt;!). One of my favourite moments was right after our presentation, when an audience member (whose name escapes me, I'm so sorry if you're reading this!) told us that we were part of very few people he'd seen accurately use grounded theory. I doubt this is true, but it was flattering nonetheless.&lt;/p&gt;

This meant that every time I updated a post, changed my resume, etc., I had to hard code the changes and the ripple effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What was I thinking. Honestly. You can look at how painful it was &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/VickySteeves/personal-website/tree/OLD/static"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; on GitHub. I kept it as a reminder and in case I severely messed up this whole Nikola thing, which I'm going to explain in the bulk of this post.&lt;/p&gt;

After just about a year of emails, hangouts, and calls, I was excited to see the space in which I think some really innovative tech is being developed for the open X community. The second week of July was designated as SHARE week: Monday and Tuesday was the SHARE hackathon, Wednesday and half of Thursday was the SHARE community meeting, and the last half of Thursday and Friday was the SHARE Curation Associates kick off orientation. &lt;/p&gt;

Planning, executing, attending, surveying -- you name it, I've been doing it in relation to some event or another. It's actually been great, but &lt;em&gt;so exhausting&lt;/em&gt;. I am definitely giving a lot of props to event planners for doing this as their day-to-day.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;So, I kind of am in love with the &lt;a href="https://www.force11.org/meetings/force2016"&gt;FORCE conference&lt;/a&gt; I just went to. FORCE2016 is the annual conference from an organization called FORCE11 (ha, the year they started the org.). This year, 500 people came from around the world: researchers, librarians, software developers, large scale repositories, open science advocates, and everyone in between. It was not only a very diverse conference in terms of home country and job, but also in the way the conference and program was run.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;First, one of the coolest things I have ever seen: in addition to the MULTITUDE of tweets around the event (seriously everyone was so active, it was amazing), they hired a company to take visual notes!! While everything was going on!! Everyone, the gist of their talks, panels, lightning talks, EVERYTHING! Such a great idea and it produced a great visual overview of the con!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://vickysteeves.com/blog/force-2016/"&gt;Read more‚Ä¶&lt;/a&gt; (5 min remaining to read)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>conference report</category><category>professional development</category><guid>http://vickysteeves.com/blog/force-2016/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 20 Apr 2016 18:08:25 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Getting Use Cases is Hard</title><link>http://vickysteeves.com/blog/getting-use-cases/</link><dc:creator>Vicky Steeves</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;!--

		&lt;p&gt;One of my big tasks since coming into NYU last August was to work on the &lt;a href="https://github.com/ViDA-NYU/reprozip"&gt;ReproZip&lt;/a&gt; project. My role is largely outreach and education: I was tasked with teaching ReproZip and general reproducibility principles, gathering use cases in a wider variety of disciplines (when I arrived, the use cases were largely in computer science), and supporting users in general.&lt;/p&gt;
				
		&lt;p&gt;ReproZip kind of blew my mind when I arrived; it's an open source software tool that simplifies the process of creating reproducible experiments. Basically it tracks operating system calls and creates a package that contains all the binaries, files, and dependencies required to reproduce the experiment. A reviewer can then extract the experiment on their own machine using ANY operating system (even if it's different from the original one!!) to reproduce the results. As a librarian, I was like "OH MY GOD. THE DIGITAL PRESERVATION GAME JUST GOT UPPED." Anyway, here's basically how ReproZip works -- in 2 steps:&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;This past week, February 8-12th, was &lt;a href="https://loveyourdata.wordpress.com/"&gt;Love Your Data Week&lt;/a&gt;!! Is there a more perfect holiday for data librarians, especially right before Valentine's Day??&lt;/p&gt;
			
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23LYD16&amp;amp;src=tyah"&gt;#LYD16&lt;/a&gt; was a social media event coordinated officially by 27 academic and research institutions, of which both &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/nyudataservices"&gt;NYU Data Services&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NYU_HSL"&gt;NYU Health Sciences Library&lt;/a&gt; were a part. The idea behind this social media blitz was to raise awareness of research data management and the support/resources for RDM at each individual institution. &lt;/p&gt;
			
	&lt;p&gt;Although just under 30 institutions officially were a part of the team, MANY MORE ended up joining the conversation on social media and jumping in, sharing their own thoughts and resources. We saw input from commercial organizations, researchers, faculty members, librarians, non-profits, and even academic journals! It was really great to see a conversation started around data stewardship and the importance of loving your data as much as it loves you!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;a href="http://vickysteeves.com/resume.html"&gt;resume&lt;/a&gt; page, you'll see I haven't been at my position
  at NYU for very long. January 3rd marks the fifth month (to the day!) that I've been
  NYU's official "Research Data Management and Reproducibility Librarian." There was a
  bit of an adjustment period where I just spent the majority of my time introducing
  myself to my colleagues, getting to know what my daily workflow would look like, and
  brainstorm with &lt;a href="http://nmwolf.net/"&gt;Nick&lt;/a&gt; about what our &lt;a href="http://guides.nyu.edu/data_management/services"&gt;services&lt;/a&gt; will look like, some good
  groups for targeted outreach, and what &lt;a href="http://guides.nyu.edu/DS_classes"&gt;classes&lt;/a&gt; we are going to teach as a part of
  &lt;a href="http://guides.nyu.edu/c.php?g=277095&amp;amp;p=1848849"&gt;Data Services typical
  course offerings&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;This was all well and good, but since I started in August I missed the goal-setting
  timeline that is typical for my colleagues. As such, I wanted to make some, and my
  supervisor in the library thought it would be a good way to measure growth besides.
  Plus, since I'm pretty early career, setting goals for a measurable outcome was kind of
  new for something not project based. This was just trying to assess my own growth, not
  necessarily the growth of a project I'm working on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://vickysteeves.com/blog/goals-for-2016/"&gt;Read more‚Ä¶&lt;/a&gt; (7 min remaining to read)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>nyu</category><category>professional development</category><guid>http://vickysteeves.com/blog/goals-for-2016/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 15 Jan 2016 18:08:25 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
